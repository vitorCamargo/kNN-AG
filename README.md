# kNN and Genetic Algorithms
👨🏽‍💻🧠 Assignment for 'Intelligence Artificial' subject about k-NN and Genetic Algorithms.

## More Informations
This project is developed using the programming language Python3.

The main objective of this work is to use Genetic Algorithms to find out what are the characteristics that optimize the hit rate for the digit recognition problem (10 digits 0 - 9). From a training / test set, at the end it should be found what is the hit rate using the k-NN classifier with all 132 characteristics available in the training and test set, and soon after, implement a code to be used in AG's seeking to maximize hit ratio.

### How to run the program
To execute this system you just need to use the following command:
```sh
$ python main.c training_file.txt testing_file.txt k_value
```
